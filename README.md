# School_District_Analysis
Analyzing data using jupyter


## Overview
The school board notified Maria and her supervisors that the files show evidence of academic dishonesty, more specifically in the school Thomas High school. So the board and maria has entrusted us to do a school district analysis and also go on to replace the scores of math and reading scores for Thomas High School.

## Purpose

To help fix the scores on the tests and then analyze the data we have.

## Results


I replaced the scores for math and reading scores with nans for the ninth graders in Thomas High School with Nans while keeping the rest of the data untouched ![Replaced Scores](/Resources/Nans.png)

I have also posted averages for reading and writing

![AverageReading](/Resources/avgreading.png)

And also a final conclusion of data for all the schools

##Final thoughts


Turns out there may have been a error with instructions and there was no change in the summary related to Thomas High School.
so the data can not really show a difference...
